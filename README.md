You need Java JRE > 21 installed and Apache Maven in your computer.

In your favorite virtual env :
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Then to create the database :
`python .\crear_db.py`

Then to start the project :
`python .\main.py` 

Then you need to connect to http://127.0.0.1:3000/registerSupervisor to create the first supervsor account.

You can encounter an example of exercise for the platform here : https://github.com/GeoffreyHecht/FizzBuzzPasoAPaso

Important: There seems to be a problem with path management under Windows, so I recommend using Linux (or correcting the problem).
